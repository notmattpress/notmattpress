    <h2>First Things First</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome. NotNotMattPress is a very special project to me. Every developer
      and contributor adds something unique to the mix, and together we create
      something beautiful that I am proud to be a part of. Thousands of hours
      have gone into NotNotMattPress, and we are dedicated to making it better
      every day. Thank you for making it part of your world.
    </p>

    <h2>Installation: Famous 5-minute install</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.</li>
      <li>
        Open
        <span class="file"
          ><a href="wp-admin/install.php">wp-admin/install.php</a></span
        >
        in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a
        <code>wp-config.php</code> file with your database connection details.
        <ol>
          <li>
            If for some reason this does not work, do not worry. It may not work
            on all web hosts. Open up <code>wp-config-sample.php</code> with a
            text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database
            connection details.
          </li>
          <li>Save the file as <code>wp-config.php</code> and upload it.</li>
          <li>
            Open
            <span class="file"
              ><a href="wp-admin/install.php">wp-admin/install.php</a></span
            >
            in your browser.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the
        tables needed for your site. If there is an error, double check your
        <code>wp-config.php</code> file, and try again. If it fails again,
        please go to the
        <a href="https://notNotMatt.press/support/forums/"
          >NotNotMattPress support forums</a
        >
        with as much data as you can gather.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >If you did not enter a password, note the password given to
          you.</strong
        >
        If you did not provide a username, it will be <code>admin</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The installer should then send you to the
        <a href="wp-login.php">login page</a>. Sign in with the username and
        password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated
        for you, you can then click on &#8220;Profile&#8221; to change the
        password.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Updating</h2>
    <h3>Using the Automatic Updater</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>

        >

      </li>
      <li>You wanted more, perhaps? That&#8217;s it!</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Updating Manually</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Before you update anything, make sure you have backup copies of any
        files you may have modified such as <code>index.php</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Delete your old NotNotMattPress files, saving ones you&#8217;ve
        modified.
      </li>
      <li>Upload the new files.</li>
