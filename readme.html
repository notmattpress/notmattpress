<h2>First Things First</h2>
<p>Welcome. NotMattPress is a very special project to me. Every developer and contributor adds something unique to the mix, and together we create something beautiful that I am proud to be a part of. Thousands of hours have gone into NotMattPress, and we are dedicated to making it better every day. Thank you for making it part of your world.</p>

<h2>Installation: Famous 5-minute install</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.</li>
	<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a <code>wp-config.php</code> file with your database connection details.
		<ol>
			<li>If for some reason this does not work, do not worry. It may not work on all web hosts. Open up <code>wp-config-sample.php</code> with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.</li>
			<li>Save the file as <code>wp-config.php</code> and upload it.</li>
			<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for your site. If there is an error, double check your <code>wp-config.php</code> file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the <a href="https://notmatt.press/support/forums/">NotMattPress support forums</a> with as much data as you can gather.</li>
	<li><strong>If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you.</strong> If you did not provide a username, it will be <code>admin</code>.</li>
	<li>The installer should then send you to the <a href="wp-login.php">login page</a>. Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated for you, you can then click on &#8220;Profile&#8221; to change the password.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Updating</h2>
<h3>Using the Automatic Updater</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/update-core.php">wp-admin/update-core.php</a></span> in your browser and follow the instructions.</li>
	<li>You wanted more, perhaps? That&#8217;s it!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Updating Manually</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Before you update anything, make sure you have backup copies of any files you may have modified such as <code>index.php</code>.</li>
	<li>Delete your old NotMattPress files, saving ones you&#8217;ve modified.</li>
	<li>Upload the new files.</li>
	<li>Point your browser to <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/upgrade.php">/wp-admin/upgrade.php</a>.</span></li>
