/**
 * Class for efficiently scanning through block structure in a document
 * without parsing the entire block tree and JSON attributes into memory.
 *
 * ## Overview
 *
 * This class is designed to help analyze and modify block structure in a
 * streaming fashion and to bridge the gap between parsed block trees and
 * the text representing them.
 *
 * Use-cases for this class include but are not limited to:
 *
 *  - Counting block types in a document.
 *  - Queuing stylesheets based on the presence of various block types.
 *  - Modifying blocks of a given type, i.e. migrations, updates, and styling.
 *  - Searching for content of specific kinds, e.g. checking for blocks
 *    with certain theme support attributes, or block bindings.
 *  - Adding CSS class names to the element wrapping a block’s inner blocks.
 *
 * > *Note!* If a fully-parsed block tree of a document is necessary, including
 * >         all the parsed JSON attributes, nested blocks, and HTML, consider
 * >         using {@see \parse_blocks()} instead which will parse the document
 * >         in one swift pass.
 *
 * For typical usage, jump first to the methods {@see self::next_block()},
 * {@see self::next_delimiter()}, or {@see self::next_token()}.
 *
 * ### Values
 *
 * As a lower-level interface than {@see parse_blocks()} this class follows
 * different performance-focused values:
 *
 *  - Minimize allocations so that documents of any size may be processed
 *    on a fixed or marginal amount of memory.
 *  - Make hidden costs explicit so that calling code only has to pay the
 *    performance penalty for features it needs.
 *  - Operate with a streaming and re-entrant design to make it possible
 *    to operate on chunks of a document and to resume after pausing.
 *
 * This means that some operations might appear more cumbersome than one
 * might expect. This design tradeoff opens up opportunity to wrap this in
 * a convenience class to add higher-level functionality.
 *
 * ## Concepts
 *
 * All text documents can be considered a block document containing a combination
 * of “freeform HTML” and explicit block structure. Block structure forms through
 * special HTML comments called _delimiters_ which include a block type and,
 * optionally, block attributes encoded as a JSON object payload.
 *
 * This processor is designed to scan through a block document from delimiter to
 * delimiter, tracking how the delimiters impact the structure of the document.
 * Spans of HTML appear between delimiters. If these spans exist at the top level
 * of the document, meaning there is no containing block around them, they are
 * considered freeform HTML content. If, however, they appear _inside_ block
 * structure they are interpreted as `innerHTML` for the containing block.
 *
 * ### Tokens and scanning
 *
 * As the processor scans through a document is reports information about the token
 * on which is pauses. Tokens represent spans of text in the input comprising block
 * delimiters and spans of HTML.
 *
 *  - {@see self::next_token()} visits every contiguous subspan of text in the
 *    input document. This includes all explicit block comment delimiters and spans
 *    of HTML content (whether freeform or inner HTML).
 *  - {@see self::next_delimiter()} visits every explicit block comment delimiter
 *    unless passed a block type which covers freeform HTML content. In these cases
 *    it will stop at top-level spans of HTML and report a `null` block type.
 *  - {@see self::next_block()} visits every block delimiter which _opens_ a block.
 *    This includes opening block delimiters as well as void block delimiters. With
 *    the same exception as above for freeform HTML block types, this will visit
 *    top-level spans of HTML content.
 *
 * When matched on a particular token, the following methods provide structural
 * and textual information about it:
 *
 *  - {@see self::get_delimiter_type()} reports whether the delimiter is an opener,
 *    a closer, or if it represents a whole void block.
 *  - {@see self::get_block_type()} reports the fully-qualified block type which
 *    the delimiter represents.
 *  - {@see self::get_printable_block_type()} reports the fully-qualified block type,
 *    but returns `core/freeform` instead of `null` for top-level freeform HTML content.
 *  - {@see self::is_block_type()} indicates if the delimiter represents a block of
 *    the given block type, or wildcard or pseudo-block type described below.
 *  - {@see self::opens_block()} indicates if the delimiter opens a block of one
 *    of the provided block types. Opening, void, and top-level freeform HTML content
 *    all open blocks.
 *  - {@see static::get_attributes()} is currently reserved for a future streaming
 *    JSON parser class.
 *  - {@see self::allocate_and_return_parsed_attributes()} extracts the JSON attributes
 *    for delimiters which open blocks and return the fully-parsed attributes as an
 *    associative array. {@see static::get_last_json_error()} for when this fails.
 *  - {@see self::is_html()} indicates if the token is a span of HTML which might
 *    be top-level freeform content or a block’s inner HTML.
 *  - {@see self::get_html_content()} returns the span of HTML.
 *  - {@see self::get_span()} for the byte offset and length into the input document
 *    representing the token.
 *
 * It’s possible for the processor to fail to scan forward if the input document ends
 * in a proper prefix of an explicit block comment delimiter. For example, if the input
 * ends in `<!-- wp:` then it _might_ be the start of another delimiter. The parser
 * cannot know, however, and therefore refuses to proceed. {@see static::get_last_error()}
 * to distinguish between a failure to find the next token and an incomplete input.
 *
 * ### Block types
 *
 * A block’s “type” comprises an optional _namespace_ and _name_. If the namespace
 * isn’t provided it will be interpreted as the implicit `core` namespace. For example,
 * the type `gallery` is the name of the block in the `core` namespace, but the type
 * `abc/gallery` is the _fully-qualified_ block type for the block whose name is still
 * `gallery`, but in the `abc` namespace.
 *
 * Methods on this class are aware of this block naming semantic and anywhere a block
 * type is an argument to a method it will be normalized to account for implicit namespaces.
 * Passing `paragraph` is the same as passing `core/paragraph`. On the contrary, anywhere
 * this class returns a block type, it will return the fully-qualified and normalized form.
 * For example, for the `<!-- wp:group -->` delimiter it will return `core/group` as the
 * block type.
 *
 * There are two special block types that change the behavior of the processor:
 *
 *  - The wildcard `*` represents _any block_. In addition to matching all block types,
 *    it also represents top-level freeform HTML whose block type is reported as `null`.
 *
 *  - The `core/freeform` block type is a pseudo-block type which explicitly matches
 *    top-level freeform HTML.
 *
 * These special block types can be passed into any method which searches for blocks.
 *
 * There is one additional special block type which may be returned from
 * {@see self::get_printable_block_type()}. This is the `#innerHTML` type, which
 * indicates that the HTML span on which the processor is paused is inner HTML for
 * a containing block.
 *
 * ### Spans of HTML
 *
 * Non-block content plays a complicated role in processing block documents. This
 * processor exposes tools to help work with these spans of HTML.
 *
 *  - {@see self::is_html()} indicates if the processor is paused at a span of
 *    HTML but does not differentiate between top-level freeform content and inner HTML.
 *  - {@see self::is_non_whitespace_html()} indicates not only if the processor
 *    is paused at a span of HTML, but also whether that span incorporates more than
 *    whitespace characters. Because block serialization often inserts newlines between
 *    block comment delimiters, this is useful for distinguishing “real” freeform
 *    content from purely aesthetic syntax.
 *  - {@see self::is_block_type()} matches top-level freeform HTML content when
 *    provided one of the special block types described above.
 *
 * ### Block structure
 *
 * As the processor traverses block delimiters it maintains a stack of which blocks are
 * open at the given place in the document where it’s paused. This stack represents the
 * block structure of a document and is used to determine where blocks end, which blocks
 * represent inner blocks, whether a span of HTML is top-level freeform content, and
 * more. Investigate the stack with {@see self::get_breadcrumbs()}, which returns an
 * array of block types starting at the outermost-open block and descending to the
 * currently-visited block.
 *
 * Unlike {@parse_blocks()}, spans of HTML appear in this structure as the special
 * reported block type `#html`. Such a span represents inner HTML for a block if the
 * depth reported by {@see self::get_depth()} is greater than one.
 *
 * It will generally not be necessary to inspect the stack of open blocks, though
 * depth may be important for finding where blocks end. When visiting a block opener,
 * the depth will have been increased before pausing; in contrast the depth is
 * decremented before visiting a closer. This makes the following an easy way to
 * determine if a block is still open.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     $depth = $processor->get_depth();
 *     while ( $processor->next_token() && $processor->get_depth() > $depth ) {
 *         continue
 *     }
 *     // Processor is now paused at the token immediately following the closed block.
 *
 * #### Extracting blocks
 *
 * A unique feature of this processor is the ability to return the same output as
 * {@see \parse_blocks()} would produce, but for a subset of the input document.
 * For example, it’s possible to extract an image block, manipulate that parsed
 * block, and re-serialize it into the original document. It’s possible to do so
 * while skipping over the parse of the rest of the document.
 *
 * {@see self::extract_block()} will scan forward from the current block opener
 * and build the parsed block structure until the current block is closed. It will
 * include all inner HTML and inner blocks, and parse all of the inner blocks. It
 * can be used to extract a block at any depth in the document, helpful for operating
 * on blocks within nested structure.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     if ( ! $processor->next_block( 'gallery' ) ) {
 *         return $post_content;
 *     }
 *
 *     $gallery_at    = $processor->get_span()->start;
 *     $gallery_block = $processor->extract_block();
 *     $after_gallery = $processor->get_span()->start;
 *     return (
 *         substr( $post_content, 0, $gallery_at ) .
 *         serialize_block( modify_gallery( $gallery_block ) .
 *         substr( $post_content, $after_gallery )
 *     );
 *
 * #### Handling of malformed structure
 *
 * There are situations where closing block delimiters appear for which no open block
 * exists, or where a document ends before a block is closed, or where a closing block
 * delimiter appears but references a different block type than the most-recently
 * opened block does. In all of these cases, the stack of open blocks should mirror
 * the behavior in {@see \parse_blocks()}.
 *
 * Unlike {@see \parse_blocks()}, however, this processor can still operate on the
 * invalid block delimiters. It provides a few functions which can be used for building
 * custom and non-spec-compliant error handling.
 *
 *  - {@see self::has_closing_flag()} indicates if the block delimiter contains the
 *    closing flag at the end. Some invalid block delimiters might contain both the
 *    void and closing flag, in which case {@see self::get_delimiter_type()} will
 *    report that it’s a void block.
 *  - {@see static::get_last_error()} indicates if the processor reached an invalid
 *    block closing. Depending on the context, {@see \parse_blocks()} might instead
 *    ignore the token or treat it as freeform HTML content.
 *
 * ## Static helpers
 *
 * This class provides helpers for performing semantic block-related operations.
 *
 *  - {@see self::normalize_block_type()} takes a block type with or without the
 *    implicit `core` namespace and returns a fully-qualified block type.
 *  - {@see self::are_equal_block_types()} indicates if two spans across one or
 *    more input texts represent the same fully-qualified block type.
 *
 * ## Subclassing
 *
 * This processor is designed to accurately parse a block document. Therefore, many
 * of its methods are not meant for subclassing. However, overall this class supports
 * building higher-level convenience classes which may choose to subclass it. For those
 * classes, avoid re-implementing methods except for the list below. Instead, create
 * new names representing the higher-level concepts being introduced. For example, instead
 * of creating a new method named `next_block()` which only advances to blocks of a given
 * kind, consider creating a new method named something like `next_layout_block()` which
 * won’t interfere with the base class method.
 *
 *  - {@see static::get_last_error()} may be reimplemented to report new errors in the subclass
 *    which aren’t intrinsic to block parsing.
 *  - {@see static::get_attributes()} may be reimplemented to provide a streaming interface
 *    to reading and modifying a block’s JSON attributes. It should be fast and memory efficient.
 *  - {@see static::get_last_json_error()} may be reimplemented to report new errors introduced
 *    with a reimplementation of {@see static::get_attributes()}.
